A simple but powerful LoRA key converter for ComfyUI. This node is designed to help you convert LoRA models with old or non-standard key names to the new format, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of ComfyUI and other platforms.

üìù This node also fixes issues with LoRA models trained and produced with [FAL.AI](https://fal.ai), which may not work correctly in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) or with [ComfyUI-nunchaku](https://github.com/nunchaku-tech/ComfyUI-nunchaku) nodes.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with LoRA models trained with [FAL.AI](https://fal.ai), this node can help. These models often have non-standard key names that can cause them to fail in ComfyUI. This node will automatically convert the keys to the correct format, allowing you to use them in your workflows.

## Feature List üöÄ

*   **Batch Conversion:** Convert a single LoRA file or an entire directory of LoRA files at once.
*   **Dry Run Mode:** Simulate the conversion process without actually modifying any files, allowing you to see what changes will be made.
*   **Customizable Output:** Specify a custom output directory and filename prefix for your converted files.
*   **Error Handling:** The node will skip files that have already been converted and report any errors that occur during the conversion process.
